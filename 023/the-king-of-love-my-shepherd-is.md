--- 

The King of love my shepherd is,  
whose goodness faileth never.  
I nothing lack if I am his,  
and he is mine forever. 

Where streams of living water flow,  
my ransomed soul he leadeth;   
and where the verdant pastures grow,   
with food celestial feedeth.  

Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed,  
but yet in love he sought me;  
and on his shoulder gently laid,  
and home, rejoicing, brought me.  

In death's dark vale I fear no ill,  
with thee, dear Lord, beside me;  
thy rod and staff my comfort still,  
thy cross before to guide me.  

Thou spreadst a table in my sight;  
thy unction grace bestoweth;  
and oh, what transport of delight  
from thy pure chalice floweth!  

And so through all the length of days,  
thy goodness faileth never;  
Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise  
within thy house forever.
