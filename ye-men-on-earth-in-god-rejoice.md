Ye men on earth, in God rejoice,  
with parise set forth his Name:  
Exalt his might with heart and voice,  
give glory to the same.  

How wonderful, O Lord, say ye,  
in all thy works thou art!  
Thy foes for fear shall seek to thee,  
full sore against their heart.  

All men that dwell the earth throughout  
shall praise the Name of God.  
The laud whereof the world about  
is showed and set abroad.  

All folk come forth, behold and see  
what things the Lord hath wrought;  
Makr well the wondrous works that he  
for men to pass hath brought.
