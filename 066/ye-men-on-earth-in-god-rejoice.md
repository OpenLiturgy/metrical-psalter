Ye men on earth, in God re -- joice,  
with praise set forth his Name:  
Ex -- alt his might with heart and voice,  
give glo -- ry to the same.  

How won -- der -- ful, O Lord, say ye,  
in all thy works thou art!  
Thy foes for fear shall seek to thee,  
full sore a -- gainst their heart.  

All men that dwell the earth through -- out  
shall praise the Name of God.  
The laud where -- of the world about  
is showed and set abroad.  

All folk come forth, be -- hold and see  
what things the Lord hath wrought;  
Mark well the won -- drous works that he  
for men to pass hath brought.
