Praise the Lord of heav -- en;  
Praise him in the height;  
Praise him, all ye an -- gels;  
Praise him, stars and light;  
Praise him, skies and wa -- ters,  
Which a -- bove the skies,  
When his word com -- mand -- ed,  
stab -- lished did a -- rise.  
  
Praise the Lord, ye foun -- tains  
Of the deeps and seas,  
Rocks and hills and moun -- tains,  
Ce -- dars and all trees;  
Praise him, clouds and va -- pors,  
Snow and hail and fire,  
Storm -- y wind ful -- fill -- ing  
On -- ly his de -- sire.  
  
Praise him, fowls and cat -- tle,  
Prin -- ces and all kings;  
Praise him, men and maid -- ens,  
All cre -- a -- ted things;  
For the name of God is  
Ex -- cel -- ent a -- lone;  
On the earth his foot -- stool,  
O -- ver heav'n his throne.
